* Development
** TODO AcidDevTools::valid needs to include outdated built packages.
** TODO Need to improve our package updater.
    Need to run this during our package updates
    update.packages(checkBuilt = TRUE)
** TODO `install`: Direct zip file input isn't working correctly here.
    At least this is the case on Windows.
** TODO Need to buy a Windows laptop and test all packages.
** TODO `check`: Consider adding direct tarball and/or ZIP file checking.
    This is useful in particular for Windows.
** TODO `check`: Consider checking all R Markdown templates in packages that
    provide them, such as bcbioRNASeq.
** TODO `install`: Consider reinstalling other Rcpp packages on Rcpp update.
    Applies to RcppAnnoy (for Seurat), RcppArmadillo, etc...
** TODO Expand branch automatically to match input of multiple repos.
